# Simple Vault Validation Pipeline
The intent of this repository/demo is to provide an example of a validation pipeline that can be used in the operational management of Vault.


## Planned Changes
I intend to expand this demonstration out in a manner that would mimic a full production simulataion. Below is a list of items that will bring it to that point:

 - Expand Vault Cluster to 5 Nodes with Raft Peering
 - Restore a Snapshot
 - Create Additional Use Cases for Testing
